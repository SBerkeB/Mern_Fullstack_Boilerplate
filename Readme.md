# Project Name

## Purpose

- **I developed / am developing this project to:**

- **Personal**: Gain a better understanding of Full Stack, SOLID, proper architecturized development and learning new technologies.
- **Community**: Lack of highly reusable (Modular) Full (MERN) Stack boilerplate on GitHub, IMHO.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

### TypeScript

### Frontend

- **React**
- **React Router**: Declarative routing for React.
- **Tailwind**: In the future.

### Backend

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB**

### Testing

- **None** I have not used any testing tools for this project.

## In the Future / Planning

This project currently lacks these important features:

-Frontend styles (Will be coded with Tailwind)
-Docker
-OAuth codes for most used APIs (Google, Facebook, Twitter/X etc.)
-Working authentication system (Functions are coded)
-Comment lines for every function (For modularity purposes)
-Web3 (Planning to learn Solidity in the future) 

## Important

I am a learning - junior developer. So this project may have many faults. If you spot any problematic detail, please do inform me since I am learning Full Stack development with proper architecture and SOLID with this project.

### Any code inside any file can and must be revised by experienced developers. Please provide me any feedback you have.
